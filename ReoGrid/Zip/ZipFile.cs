// This module is part of DotNetZip, a zipfile class library.
// The class library reads and writes zip files, according to the format
// described by PKware, at:
// http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/popups/appnote.txt
//
//
// There are other Zip class libraries available.
//
// - it is possible to read and write zip files within .NET via the J# runtime.
//   But some people don't like to install the extra DLL, which is no longer
//   supported by MS. And also, the J# libraries don't support advanced zip
//   features, like ZIP64, spanned archives, or AES encryption.
//
// - There are third-party GPL and LGPL libraries available. Some people don't
//   like the license, and some of them don't support all the ZIP features, like AES.
//
// - Finally, there are commercial tools (From ComponentOne, XCeed, etc).  But
//   some people don't want to incur the cost.
//
// This alternative implementation is **not** GPL licensed. It is free of cost, and
// does not require J#. It does require .NET 2.0.  It balances a good set of
// features, with ease of use and speed of performance.
//
// This code is released under the Microsoft Public License .
// See the License.txt for details.
//
//
// NB: This implementation originally relied on the
// System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream base class in the .NET Framework
// v2.0 base class library, but now includes a managed-code port of Zlib.

	///   The ZipFile type represents a zip archive file.
	/// </summary>
	///
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	///   This is the main type in the DotNetZip class library. This class reads and
	///   writes zip files, as defined in the <see
	///   href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">specification
	///   for zip files described by PKWare</see>.  The compression for this
	///   implementation is provided by a managed-code version of Zlib, included with
	///   DotNetZip in the classes in the Ionic.Zlib namespace.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   This class provides a general purpose zip file capability.  Use it to read,
	///   create, or update zip files.  When you want to create zip files using a
	///   <c>Stream</c> type to write the zip file, you may want to consider the <see
	///   cref="ZipOutputStream"/> class.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Both the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can
	///   be used to create zip files. Both of them support many of the common zip
	///   features, including Unicode, different compression methods and levels,
	///   and ZIP64. They provide very similar performance when creating zip
	///   files.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   The <c>ZipFile</c> class is generally easier to use than
	///   <c>ZipOutputStream</c> and should be considered a higher-level interface.  For
	///   example, when creating a zip file via calls to the <c>PutNextEntry()</c> and
	///   <c>Write()</c> methods on the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class, the caller is
	///   responsible for opening the file, reading the bytes from the file, writing
	///   those bytes into the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, setting the attributes on the
	///   <c>ZipEntry</c>, and setting the created, last modified, and last accessed
	///   timestamps on the zip entry. All of these things are done automatically by a
	///   call to <see cref="ZipFile.AddFile(string,string)">ZipFile.AddFile()</see>.
	///   For this reason, the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> is generally recommended for use
	///   only when your application emits arbitrary data, not necessarily data from a
	///   filesystem file, directly into a zip file, and does so using a <c>Stream</c>
	///   metaphor.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Aside from the differences in programming model, there are other
	///   differences in capability between the two classes.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <list type="bullet">
	///   <item>
	///     <c>ZipFile</c> can be used to read and extract zip files, in addition to
	///     creating zip files. <c>ZipOutputStream</c> cannot read zip files. If you want
	///     to use a stream to read zip files, check out the <see cref="ZipInputStream"/> class.
	///   </item>
	///
	///   <item>

	/// <summary>
	///   Options for using ZIP64 extensions when saving zip archives.
	/// </summary>
	///
	/// <remarks>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Designed many years ago, the <see
	///   href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">original zip
	///   specification from PKWARE</see> allowed for 32-bit quantities for the
	///   compressed and uncompressed sizes of zip entries, as well as a 32-bit quantity
	///   for specifying the length of the zip archive itself, and a maximum of 65535
	///   entries.  These limits are now regularly exceeded in many backup and archival
	///   scenarios.  Recently, PKWare added extensions to the original zip spec, called
	///   "ZIP64 extensions", to raise those limitations.  This property governs whether
	///   DotNetZip will use those extensions when writing zip archives. The use of
	///   these extensions is optional and explicit in DotNetZip because, despite the
	///   status of ZIP64 as a bona fide standard, many other zip tools and libraries do
	///   not support ZIP64, and therefore a zip file with ZIP64 extensions may be
	///   unreadable by some of those other tools.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Set this property to <see cref="Zip64Option.Always"/> to always use ZIP64
	///   extensions when saving, regardless of whether your zip archive needs it.
	///   Suppose you add 5 files, each under 100k, to a ZipFile. If you specify Always
	///   for this flag, you will get a ZIP64 archive, though the archive does not need
	///   to use ZIP64 because none of the original zip limits had been exceeded.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Set this property to <see cref="Zip64Option.Never"/> to tell the DotNetZip
	///   library to never use ZIP64 extensions.  This is useful for maximum
	///   compatibility and interoperability, at the expense of the capability of
	///   handling large files or large archives.  NB: Windows Explorer in Windows XP
	///   and Windows Vista cannot currently extract files from a zip64 archive, so if
	///   you want to guarantee that a zip archive produced by this library will work in
	///   Windows Explorer, use <c>Never</c>. If you set this property to <see
	///   cref="Zip64Option.Never"/>, and your application creates a zip that would
	///   exceed one of the Zip limits, the library will throw an exception while saving
	///   the zip file.
	/// </para>
	///
	/// <para>
	///   Set this property to <see cref="Zip64Option.AsNecessary"/> to tell the
	///   DotNetZip library to use the ZIP64 extensions when required by the
	///   entry. After the file is compressed, the original and compressed sizes are
	///   checked, and if they exceed the limits described above, then zip64 can be
	///   used. That is the general idea, but there is an additional wrinkle when saving
	///   to a non-seekable device, like the ASP.NET <c>Response.OutputStream</c>, or
	///   <c>Console.Out</c>.  When using non-seekable streams for output, the entry
	///   header - which indicates whether zip64 is in use - is emitted before it is
	///   known if zip64 is necessary.  It is only after all entries have been saved
	///   that it can be known if ZIP64 will be required.  On seekable output streams,
	///   after saving all entries, the library can seek backward and re-emit the zip
	///   file header to be consistent with the actual ZIP64 requirement.  But using a
	///   non-seekable output stream, the library cannot seek backward, so the header
	///   can never be changed. In other words, the archive's use of ZIP64 extensions is
	///   not alterable after the header is emitted.  Therefore, when saving to
	///   non-seekable streams, using <see cref="Zip64Option.AsNecessary"/> is the same
	///   as using <see cref="Zip64Option.Always"/>: it will always produce a zip
	///   archive that uses ZIP64 extensions.
